This software may be redistributed, modified and forked as long as the author is mentioned and given credit for original work.

This software may be used in order to automate a monotonous activity in game, as long as such activity could be solved by a better WAR API. Should WAR API have the entire functionality of this software, this software should not be used anymore

Each time one launches this software, one is obligated to make a prayer to Callahan first then to Thea Maro, thanking both of them for the blessing of logistics that are delivered to the front, for the leadership shown by others, and for the targets that scour the battlefield.
